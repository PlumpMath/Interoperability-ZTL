# Interoperability-ZTL

Theoretical smart implementation of a limited traffic zone scenario, based on semantic Web and interoperable IoT devices.
The project involved various technologies, including:

- Stanford's Protégé as graphics tool for designing the domain ontology;

- OSGI as Semantic Information Broker (SIB);

- Sparql as query language for interacting with the SIB;

- Java/Android to realize simple smart devices for testing purposes.
